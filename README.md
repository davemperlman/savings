#This project creates a variation of a popular money saving challenge put forth within the past couple years on social media. It effectively uses conditional loops to manipulate the outcome of the equation, affecting the amount saved, the amount put away per week, and whether or not to put away money biweekly. It also takes advantage of PHP's date and time functionality to affect the outcome based on the day of the week the user chooses to contribute money.
